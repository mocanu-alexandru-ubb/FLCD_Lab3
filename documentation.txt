EBNF for Finite Automata input:

input = assignments '\n' "S=" '\n' transitions
assignments = identifier '=' value
identifier = 'F' | 'Q' | "Q0" | 'E'
value = constant { ',' value }
constant = litteraly orice
transitions = transition { '\n' transitions }
transition = constant ',' constant ',' constant
