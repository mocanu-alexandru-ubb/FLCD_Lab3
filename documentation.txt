The scanner reads each line from the input file. It splits the line on whitespaces, keeping string constants intact.
The PIF is kept simply in a file, each line representing an entry in the PIF.

To test if a sequence is accepted by the Finite Automata, we follow the following process:
0. Start from the initial state.
1. Check if we have generated the whole initial sequence. If so, we found our answer.
2. Check if we generated a sequence longer than the initial sequence. If so, we can't continue from this state.
3. Go trough all the possible transitions from the current state.
4. If a transition adds the expected letter to our generated sequence start the process from step 1 with the new state.


EBNF for Finite Automata input:

input = assignments '\n' "S=" '\n' transitions
assignments = identifier '=' value
identifier = 'F' | 'Q' | "Q0" | 'E'
value = constant { ',' value }
constant = litteraly orice
transitions = transition { '\n' transitions }
transition = constant ',' constant ',' constant
